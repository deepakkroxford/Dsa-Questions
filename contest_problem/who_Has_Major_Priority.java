         * Given an array arril of size n and two elements x and y. Find the element
         * which is occuring more number of times than other. If both x and y are
         * occurring for equal number of times return the smaller of them.
         * Note: We need to return the element, not its count.
         * Example 1:
         * Input:
         * n = 11
         * arr[] = {1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,4,4,5}
         * x = 4, Ð£ = 5
         * Output: 4
         * Explanation:
         * frequency of 4 is 4. frequency of 5 is 1.
         * 
         * Input:
         * n = 8
         * arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}
         * x = 1, y = 7
         * Output: 1
         * Explanation:
         * frequency of 1 is 1. frequency of 7 is 1.
         * Since 1 < 7, return 1.
         * Your Task:
         * You don't need to read input or print anything. Complete the function
         * majorityWins) that takes array arr, n, x, y as input parameters and return
         * the element withhigher frequency.
         * Constraints:
         * 1 <=n <= 10^3
         * O<=arri, x,y<= 10^8
         *
