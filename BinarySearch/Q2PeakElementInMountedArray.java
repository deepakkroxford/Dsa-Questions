         * leetcode :- 162. Find Peak Element
         * https://leetcode.com/problems/find-peak-element/description/
         * 
         * 
         * A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.
         * 
         * Given a 0-indexed integer array nums, find a peak element, and return its
         * index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the
         * peaks.
         * 
         * You may imagine that nums[-1] = nums[n] = -âˆž. In other words, an element is
         * always considered to be strictly greater than a neighbor that is outside the
         * array.
         * 
         * You must write an algorithm that runs in O(log n) time.
         * 
         * 
         * 
         * Example 1:
         * 
         * Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
         * Output: 2
         * Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index
         * number 2.
         * Example 2:
         * 
         * Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
         * Output: 5
         * Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak
         * element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
